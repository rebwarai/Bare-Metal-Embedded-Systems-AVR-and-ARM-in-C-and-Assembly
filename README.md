# 🧠 Bare-Metal Embedded Systems (AVR & ARM) in C & Assembly

Welcome to the official repository for my YouTube series **"Bare-Metal Embedded Systems (AVR & ARM) in C & Assembly"** — where we learn **embedded programming from the ground up**, one register at a time.

This series is all about understanding how microcontrollers *really* work — from blinking an LED to building advanced embedded projects — using **pure C** and **Assembly**, with **no libraries, no frameworks**, and **full control over the hardware**.

---

## 🎯 What This Series Is About

In this series, we’ll explore both **AVR** (like the ATmega2560) and **ARM Cortex-M** (like the ATSAM3X8E) architectures.  
By mastering both, you’ll gain the ability to move between 8-bit and 32-bit systems with confidence — understanding exactly what happens inside the microcontroller at the register level.

You’ll learn how to:
- Configure and control **GPIO, timers, interrupts, and communication interfaces** (UART, SPI, I²C, CAN)
- Write **bare-metal C and Assembly code**
- Build your own **device drivers and reusable modules**
- Understand **startup code, memory layout, and linker scripts**
- Create **real-world projects** like sensor systems, motor controllers, and IoT devices

## 🧩 Who This Series Is For

Whether you’re:
- A **beginner** curious about how embedded systems actually work  
- A **hobbyist** who loves building electronics and robots  
- Or an **aspiring embedded engineer** preparing for professional projects  

…this series is for you.  
No prior experience with microcontrollers is required — we’ll start simple and build up gradually.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Gain

By the end of this series, you’ll be able to:
- Write firmware directly at the register level  
- Configure and control hardware peripherals manually  
- Debug, test, and optimize your embedded code  
- Understand and design complete embedded systems from scratch  

Basically, you’ll have the skills to bring your **own electronics to life.**
