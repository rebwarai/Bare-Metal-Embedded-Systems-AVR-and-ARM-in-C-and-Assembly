In this episode, we bring our pure AVR Assembly code to life on the Arduino Mega (ATmega2560).

You’ll learn the complete embedded development workflow using the AVR toolchain:

✔️ Assembling your .asm source into an object file
✔️ Linking it into an ELF executable
✔️ Converting it into an Intel HEX file
✔️ Uploading the firmware with avrdude
✔️ Creating a full Makefile to automate the entire build + upload process
