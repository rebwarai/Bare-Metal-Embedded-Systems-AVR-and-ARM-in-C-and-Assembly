📘 Episode 007 – Registers & Addresses (Part 2)
In this episode, we continue building our bare-metal foundation on the ATSAM3X8E by diving deeper into register mapping and clock configuration.
🧠 What you’ll learn in this video:
⚡ PMC Status Register (PMC_SR) flags
⏱️ Master Clock (MCK) selection & prescaler
🔥 Flash wait-state configuration for high-speed operation
💡 PIO (GPIO) register mapping to control an LED
🧩 How register definitions let us synchronize with real hardware
